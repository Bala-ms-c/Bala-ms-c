# 👋 Hi, I'm **Bala Subramanian C**

🎯 **QA Automation Engineer** with 3.9 years of experience in testing web and API applications across insurance and travel domains. I specialize in building automation frameworks using **Selenium, Java, TestNG, and Rest Assured**, backed by Agile best practices. I’ve also explored AI/ML to bring smart automation and predictive insights into the QA process.

## 🧪 What I Do Best (QA Automation Focus)
- Automate UI workflows using Selenium WebDriver + TestNG + POM
- Validate REST APIs using Postman & Rest Assured (Java)
- Integrate automated test suites into CI/CD pipelines (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- Implement BDD frameworks using Cucumber with Gherkin syntax
- Log, manage, and trace defects using JIRA in Agile sprint cycles
- Apply ML models for test data generation and risk-based testing (lightweight use cases)

## 💼 Key Projects
- **Insurance Quote Automation** (Solartis)  
  Automated 150+ UI test cases using Selenium POM for ISO-compliant insurance flows. Saved 30% in UAT rework and reduced prod defects.
  
- **Travel Booking Workflow Automation** (TUI – Sonata Software)  
  UI & API test automation across European markets using Selenium + Rest Assured. Logged 20+ critical defects before release.

- **Cucumber BDD for Policy Testing**  
  Created feature files + glue code using Java + Gherkin to improve collaboration with BAs and developers.
